# ðŸ¤– LLM Agents: Building Autonomous AI Workflows

This project explores how to build **LLM-powered autonomous agents** that can reason, plan, and act through tools to solve complex tasks. Inspired by the Agentic paradigm in modern AI systems, it demonstrates how you can orchestrate tool use, memory, planning, and multi-step reasoning with large language models (LLMs).

## ðŸ§  What Are LLM Agents?

LLM agents combine:
- **Reasoning** (via LLMs like GPT-4, Claude, or Mixtral)
- **Tools** (like search, calculators, and custom APIs)
- **Memory** (for short/long-term context retention)
- **Planning** (breaking tasks into sub-tasks)
- **Autonomy** (looping through steps until a goal is reached)

This repo shows you how to wire all these together.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- ðŸª„ **Task Decomposition & Planning**  
  Breaks complex instructions into manageable steps.

- ðŸ§° **Tool Execution**  
  Supports tool use (e.g., web search, calculator, file reading) from within LLM prompts.

- ðŸ’­ **Multi-step Reasoning Loop**  
  The agent thinks, acts, observes, and reflects repeatedly until a task is completed.

- ðŸ’¾ **Memory Handling**  
  Incorporates a basic memory structure to store and recall prior steps or observations.

- ðŸ§ª **Modular Components**  
  Easily plug in different LLMs, tools, or memory systems.
